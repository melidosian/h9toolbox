/* H9 Toolbox module loader: the main-flash stub (offline, not yet flashed).
 *
 * Replaces Brick Breaker in H9 Toolbox Firmware. It lives in the cave the
 * game used (app+0xA77F0, before the S2 tables at app+0xA7E50) and is entered
 * from the same my_app loop hook (app+0x088906) Brick Breaker's launcher used.
 *
 * Hold Back about 0.4 s (40 stock hold ticks, as Brick Breaker):
 *   1. ml_check validates the module bundle on the resource chip while the
 *      stock my_app frame is still intact. No valid bundle: the stock loop
 *      continues as if nothing happened (the radio stays usable).
 *   2. Otherwise call ml_main on top of my_app's own frame (Brick Breaker's launcher
 *      dropped the frame and could only reset to leave; this keeps it, which costs the
 *      menu and every module about 180 bytes of task stack: the 124-byte frame, the
 *      hook's two saved registers and ml_main's eleven):
 *        run module 0 (the menu) -> it returns the index to run, or 0
 *        run that module         -> when it returns, back to the menu
 *        menu returns 0, or the menu cannot load -> ml_main returns and the stock
 *        loop carries on (the menu has redrawn the screen; it also offers RESTART,
 *        which is the old stock cpu_reset)
 * Every other pass, rec_tick saves stock's GPS fix to the resource chip
 * when it has moved (background recorder, below).
 *
 * Storage: the "modules" upload slot (dist/doom/upload.mjs, H9DATA01
 * directory at 0xCC0000, one segment at 0xCC1000, COMPLETE marker), holding
 * one bundle:
 *   +0  "H9MODS01"  +8 u16 version 1  +10 u16 count  +12 u32 bundle bytes
 *   +16 + 32*i: name[16], u32 offset (from bundle start), u32 size,
 *              u32 bss, u16 entry (from the load address), u16 CRC-16/XMODEM
 * Each module body is linked for, and copied to, RAM 0x29F00-0x2BEFF (8 KiB
 * taken from the stock heap: app+0x05FA9E, 0x2BF00 -> 0x29F00). The stub
 * zeroes bss, checks the body CRC in RAM, then calls
 *   entry(r0 = &ml_api, r1 = own index)
 * with the JieLi clang ABI (r4-r14 preserved by the module).

 * (address r0, 32 data bytes r1, length r2, first-block flag r3). Bluetooth's
 * (app+0x5017C) is sector-aware: it reads the 4 KiB sector, erases it if the
 * new bytes need it, merges and writes back. The serial one (app+0x78248)
 * erases only when address 0 (two sectors, 0x0000-0x1FFF) or 0x5000 (one) is
 * written and otherwise just programs flash pages, which can clear bits but
 * not set them: writes to 0x3000-0x3FFF (GNSS, APRS and SMS settings) came out
 * ANDed with the old values, or "ignored", and were still ACKed
 * (resource-flash-log.md, 2026-11-11; CHIRP issue 12216). build.py points the
 * serial wrapper's ops table (the literal 0x01E78348 at app+0x78A9E) here.
 * 0x2000-0x3FFF go to Bluetooth's routine, which ignores r3; everything else
 * goes to the stock serial routine unchanged (0x4000-0x4FFF never get this far:
 * the S2 hook takes them first). */
